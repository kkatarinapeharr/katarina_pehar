	<h2>Katarina Pehar</h2>
	<p><b>Francis ‘Frank’ Albert Sinatra</b> was one of the most popular musical artists of the twentieth century. A singer and actor, in his 60-year career he sold an estimated 150 million records worldwide.

Born in Hoboken, New Jersey to Italian immigrants, Sinatra decided to become a singer after hearing Bing Crosby’s recordings in the mid-1930s. He sang in local saloons then worked as a band singer.

Radio exposure brought him to the attention of Harry James, with whom he recorded, and he sang with the Tommy Dorsey band.

<mark>Sinatra’s solo career began in 1942, as king of the bobby-soxers</mark>. His film career started in earnest starring alongside Gene Kelly in Anchors Aweigh in 1945.

An affair in the early 1950s with film star Ava Gardner ended his first marriage, and his singing career and popularity dwindled. However, in 1953 he won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for best supporting actor in From Here to Eternity, which relaunched his career.

In the 1950s Sinatra became one of Las Vegas’ best-known performers as part of the infamous ‘Rat Pack’ and released critically acclaimed albums, notably in collaboration with arranger Nelson Riddle.

He released a series of successful albums on his own Reprise Records label in the 1960s, including collaborations with Count Basie and Duke Ellington. Sinatra returned to Las Vegas in the 1970s and continued performing until 1995.

A recipient of <i>11 Grammy Awards</i>, Sinatra was known as ‘the voice’ for his mastery of both ballads and up-tempo songs.
